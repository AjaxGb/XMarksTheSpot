# X Marks the Spot
A Minecraft datapack that displays an "X" on the ground when you're near the target of a treasure map. No more digging up the entire beach to find a single chest!

The "X" appears when you're within 5 blocks of the target (horizontally, not vertically) and have the treasure map in your hands.
