# X Marks the Spot
*By AjaxGb*

A Minecraft datapack that displays an "X" on the ground when you're near the target of a treasure map. No more digging up the entire beach to find a single chest!

The "X" appears when you're holding a treasure map and within 5 (horizontal) blocks of the target.

## Known Issues

- [Particles can't be seen through transparent blocks](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-161917), so if the "X" is underwater, you'll have to get your head underwater to see it.
