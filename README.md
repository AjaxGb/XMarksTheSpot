# X Marks the Spot

A Minecraft datapack that displays an "X" on the ground when you're near the target of a treasure map. No more digging up the entire beach to find a single chest!

The "X" appears when you're holding a treasure map and within 5 (horizontal) blocks of the target.

Download the latest version from [the releases page](https://github.com/AjaxGb/XMarksTheSpot/releases).

## Known Issues

- [Particles can't be seen through transparent blocks on Fast or Fancy graphics.](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-188529) So if the "X" is underwater and your computer can't handle Fabulous graphics, you'll have to dive underwater to see it.
